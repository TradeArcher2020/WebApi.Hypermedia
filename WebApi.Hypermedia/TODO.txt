TODO: Create a way to configure default HypermediaObject objects for each DTO to be used.  
For example, if there is a BeerRepresentation DTO being returned, you should be able to define a BeerHypermediaObjectConfiguration 
object that specifies the default HypermediaObject object to use when the Formatter is serializing the BeerRepresentation object.

It would be nice if the configuration object could use reflection to look for all objects of type IHypermediaObjectConfiguration.
We could have a HypermediaObjectConfiguration<T> class so the Formatter could search for the registered HypermediaObjectConfiguration<T>
that matches the type of the current object to be serialized.
